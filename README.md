you can open landing on mobile, but its better to open it on desktop so you can experience AR on mobile.

Opening AR will open a new tab, scan the QR with your phone and will open a web.

Give permission to access camera and scan the logo to experience AR.


For crowdAR, try to lower the brightness and avoid reflections on the screen:
